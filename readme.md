## *[20202_5_5] Update: AI4eLIFE: Easing local image feature extraction using AI.*

#### <a name="introduction"> [üìë](https://github.com/KibromBerihu/LFBNet) 18F-FDG PET maximum intensity projections and artificial intelligence: **a win-win combination to easily measure prognostic biomarkers in DLBCL patients. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (JNM), 2022.** 

***Introduction:***
Baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT image-driven features have shown predictive values in Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
patients. Notably, total metabolic active tumor volume (TMTV) and tumor dissemination (Dmax) have shown predictive values to
characterize tumor burden and dissemination. However, TMTV and Dmax calculation require tumor volume 
delineation over the whole-body 3D 18F-FDG PET/CT images, which is prone to observer-variability and complicates using these quantitative features in clinical routine. In this regard, we hypothesized that tumor burden and spread could 
be automatically evaluated from only two PET Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs) images corresponding to coronal and 
sagittal views, thereby easy the calculation and validation of these features. 

Here, we developed data-driven AI to calculate surrogate biomarkers for DLBCL patients automatically. Briefly, first, the (3D)
18F-FDG PET images were projected in the coronal and sagittal directions. The projected PET MIP images are then fed to 
an AI algorithm to segment lymphoma regions automatically. From the segmented images, the surrogate TMTV (sTMTV) and 
surrogate Dmax (sDmax) are calculated and evaluated in terms of predictions for overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS).

***Results:***
Tested on an independent testing cohort (174 patients), the AI yielded a 0.86 median Dice score (IQR: 0.77-0.92), 87.9%
(IQR: 74.9.0%-94.4%) sensitivity, and 99.7% (IQR: 99.4%-99.8%) specificity. The PET MIP AI-driven surrogate biomarkers (sTMTV) and sDmax were highly correlated to the 3D 18F-FDG PET-driven biomarkers
(TMTV and Dmax) in both the training-validation cohort and the independent testing cohort. These PET MIP AI-driven 
features can be used to predict the OS and PFS in DLBCL patients, equivalent to the expert-driven 3D features. 

***Deep learning Model:*** 
We adapted the deep learning-based robust medical image segmentation method [LFB-Net](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3060497).

for details, and cite the paper if you use lfbnet for your research.

***Integrated framework:***
The whole pipeline, including the generation of PET MIPs, automatic segmentation, and sTMTV and sDmax calculation, is developed 
for a use case on personal/desktop computers or clusters. It could highly facilitate the analysis of PET MIP-based features 
leading to the potential translation of these features into clinical practice. 

Please refer to the paper for details and cite the paper if you use LFB-Net for your research.

## üìÅ Required folder structure
Please provide all data in a single directory. The method automatically analyses all given data batch-wise. 

To run the program, you only need PET scans (CT is not required) of patients in nifty format, where the PET images are coded in SUV units. If your images have already been segmented, you can also provide the mask (ground truth (GT)) as a binary image in nifty format. Suppose you provided ground truth (GT) data; it will print the dice, sensitivity, and specificity metrics between the reference segmentation by the expert (i.e., GT) and the predicted segmentation by the model. If the ground truth is NOT AVAILABLE, the model will only predict the segmentation. 

A typical data directory might look like:


    |-- main_folder                                             <-- The main folder or all patient folders (Give it any NAME)

    |      |-- parent folder (patient_folder_1)             <-- Individual patient folder name with unique id
    |           |-- PET                                     <-- The PET folder for the .nii suv file
                     | -- name.nii or name.nii.gz            <-- The PET image in nifti format (Name can be anything)
    |           |-- GT                                      <-- The corresponding ground truth folder for the .nii file  
                     | -- name.nii or name.nii.gz            <-- The ground truth (GT) image in nifti format (Name can be anything)

    |          |-- PET                                     <-- The PET folder for the .nii suv file

                    | -- name.nii or name.nii.gz            <-- The ground truth (GT) image in nifti format (Name can be anything)

### üíª Usage
This package has two usages. 
The first one is to segment tumor regions and then calculate the surrogate biomarkers such as sTMTV and sDmax on the given test dataset using the pre-trained weights, named as "easy use case". 
The second use case is transfer learning or retraining from scratch on your own dataset.

### [Easy use: testing mode](#virtual) <br/><br>
Please make sure that you organized your data as in the [Required folder structure](#directory). 
1. **Option 1:** Using the virtual environment: <br/><br>
    1. Change to the source directory: `ai4elife/' <br/><br>
    2. Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate myenv` <br/><br>
    3. Run: `python test_env.py  --input_dir path/to/input/data  --output_dir path/to/output` 
   <br/><br>
2. **Option 2:** Using the docker: <br/><br>
   
    `run_docker_image.bat path/to/input_data path/to/output_data  <docker_image_name> <Tag>  <container_id>`


### [Transfer learning mode: development](#transerlearning)
To apply transfer learning by using the trained weights or training the deep learning method from scratch,
we recommend following the virtual environment-based [installation](#virtual) option.

Run the following commands for activating the virtual enviroment, and then training, validating, and testing of the proposed model on your own dataset.

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   `conda activate myenv`
<br/><br>
2. To [train](#train) the model from a new dataset, change to the ai4elife/src directory: <br/><br>
   
   `python train.py --input_dir path/to/training_validation_data  --data_id <unique_data_name> --task <train>`
<br/><br>
3. To [evaluate](#evaluate) on the validation data: <br/><br>
    `python train.py --input_dir path/to/validation_data  --data_id <unique_data_name> --task <valid>`
<br/><br>

**Note:** You can also **configure** the deep learning model for **parameter and architectural search**. Please refer to the documentation
[configuration](architectural_and_parameter_search.md). Briefly, you can apply different features, kernel size in the convolution, depth of the neural networks, and other hyperparameters values. The segmentation 
model is designed in easy configurable mode. 
   
### üìà Results

- Two intermediate folders will be generated.

  - The resized and cropped 3D PET, and corresponding ground truth  Nifti images are saved under the folder name:
                  
      ```../output/data_default_3d_dir```, and 
  
  - The generated corresponding sagittal and coronal images are saved in the folder name       
``../output/data_default_mip_dir``.
  
  - For simplicity, the coronal PET MIP images are `PET_1.nii`, sagittal as `PET_0.nii`, and corresponding ground truth as `gt_1.nii`, and `gt_0.nii`, respectively.
  
  - NOTE: if there is no ground truth, it will only generate the coronal and sagittal PET MIPs. 
  Kindly check if these generated files are in order.
  
  
- Predicted results, including sTMTV and sDmax, will be saved into the folder `output/*.csv`, 
where the CSV file's name is automatically generated with the time of prediction in the month, year, and time.


- Surrogate biomarkers (sTMTV and sDmax) will be automatically calculated and saved as an EXCEL file inside the folder `output/*.csv`
