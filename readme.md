#### [üìë](https://github.com/KibromBerihu/LFBNet) 18F-FDG PET maximum intensity projections and artificial intelligence: **a win-win combination to easily measure prognostic biomarkers in DLBCL patients. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (JNM), 2022.** 

***Introduction:***
Baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT image-driven features have shown predictive values in Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
patients. Notably, total metabolic active tumor volume (TMTV) and tumor dissemination (Dmax) have shown predictive values to
characterize tumor burden and dissemination. However, TMTV and Dmax calculation require tumor volume 
delineation over the whole-body 3D 18F-FDG PET/CT images, which is prone to observer-variability and complicates using these quantitative features in clinical routine. In this regard, we hypothesized that tumor burden and spread could 
be automatically evaluated from only two PET Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs) images corresponding to coronal and 
sagittal views, thereby easy the calculation and validation of these features. 

Here, we developed data-driven AI to calculate surrogate biomarkers for DLBCL patients automatically. Briefly, first, the (3D)
18F-FDG PET images were projected in the coronal and sagittal directions. The projected PET MIP images are then fed to 
an AI algorithm to segment lymphoma regions automatically. From the segmented images, the surrogate TMTV (sTMTV) and 
surrogate Dmax (sDmax) are calculated and evaluated in terms of predictions for overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS).

***Results:***
Tested on an independent testing cohort (174 patients), the AI yielded a 0.86 median Dice score (IQR: 0.77-0.92), 87.9%
(IQR: 74.9.0%-94.4%) sensitivity, and 99.7% (IQR: 99.4%-99.8%) specificity. The PET MIP AI-driven surrogate biomarkers (sTMTV) and sDmax were highly correlated to the 3D 18F-FDG PET-driven biomarkers
(TMTV and Dmax) in both the training-validation cohort and the independent testing cohort. These PET MIP AI-driven 
features can be used to predict the OS and PFS in DLBCL patients, equivalent to the expert-driven 3D features. 

***Deep learning Model:*** 
We adapted the deep learning-based robust medical image segmentation method [LFB-Net](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3060497).
Please refer to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2021.3060497) 
for details and also cite the paper if you use lfbnet for your research.

***Integrated framework:***
The whole pipeline, including the generation of PET MIPs, automatic segmentation, and sTMTV and sDmax calculation, is developed 
for a use case on personal/desktop computers or clusters. It could highly facilitate the analysis of PET MIP-based features 
leading to the potential translation of these features into clinical practice.

## üìÅ Required folder structure

It automatically analyses all cases on a given directory. All cases need to be given in a parent directory of
any NAME.

A typical data directory might look like:


    |-- main_folder                                             <-- The main folder or all patient folders (Give it any NAME)

<br/><br>
3. To [evaluate](#evaluate) on the validation data: <br/><br>
    `python train.py --input_dir path/to/validation_data  --data_id unique_data_name --task valid`
<br/><br>
4. To [predict](#predict) on the testing data: <br/><br>
    `python train.py --input_dir path/to/testing_data  --data_id unique_data_name --task test`
<br/><br>

**Note:** You can also **configure** the deep learning model for ***parameter and architectural search***, please refer to the documentation 
[configuration](architectural_and_parameter_search.md). Briefly, you can apply different number of features,
kernel size in the convolution, depth of the neural networks and other hyperparameters values. The segmentation 
model is designed in easy configurable mode. 
   
### üìà Results

- Two intermediate folders will be generated.

  - The resized and cropped 3D PET and corresponding ground truth  Nifti images are saved under the folder name:
                  
      ```../lfbnet/data/RAW_DATA_FOLDER_NAME_3D```, and 
  
  - The generated crossponding sagital and coronal images are saved in the folder name       
``../lfbnet/data/RAW_DATA_FOLDER_NAME_MIP``.
  
  - For simplicity, the coronal PET MIP images are named as `PET_1.nii`, and sagtial ass `PET_0.nii`, and corresponding 
 ground truth as `gt_1.nii`, and `gt_0.nii`, respectively.
  
  - NOTE: if there is no ground truth, it will only generate the coronal and sagittal PET MIPs. 
  Kindly check if these generated files are in order.
  
  
- Predicted results will be saved into the folder `lfbnet/predicted_data_at_[ids]`
  where `ids` is automatically generated the time of prediction in the form of month, year, and time.


- Surrogate biomarkers (sTMTV and sDmax) will be automatically calculated and saved as EXCEL file inside the folder `lfbnet/predicted_data_at_[ids]`
